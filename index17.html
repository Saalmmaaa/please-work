            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <p>2 pounds fresh strawberries,<br> hulled</p>
            <p>4 cups white sugar</p>    
            <p>Â¼ cup lemon juice</p>  
        </div>    
        <div id="dir">
            <h1>Strawberry jam</h1>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Crush strawberries in a wide bowl in batches until you have 4 cups of mashed berries.</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Combine mashed strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a heavy-bottomed saucepan;stir over low heat<br> until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to high,and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil.<br>Continue to boil,stirring often, until the mixture reaches 220 degrees F (105 degrees C).</p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Check doneness after 10 to 15 minutes by dropping a small spoonful of jam onto a frozen plate. Let sit for<br>1 to 2 minutes; if jam appears to gel, it is ready. Continue cooking if jam appears thin and runny.</p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Transfer jam into hot sterile jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly</p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill it halfway with water.Bring to a boil and lower <br>jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars<br> by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars<br> from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart,for 12 to 24 hours. Store in a cool, dark area.</p>
