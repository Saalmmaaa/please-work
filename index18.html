            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <p>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</p>
            <p>1 cup warm water <br>(110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</p>
            <p>¾ cup evaporated milk</p>    
            <p>1 ½ teaspoons salt</p>
            <p>⅓ cup white sugar</p>    
            <p>1 egg</p>    
            <p>5 cups all-purpose flour, divided</p>
            <p>¼ cup butter, melted</p>
            <p>1 cup butter, chilled and diced</p>
            <p>1 egg, beaten</p>
        </div>    
        <div id="dir">
            <h1>croissant</h1>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in milk, salt, sugar,<br>1 egg, 1 cup flour and melted butter. Beat to make a smooth batter; set aside.</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>In a large bowl, cut the one cup firm butter into remaining four cups flour until butter particles are the size of <br>dried kidney beans. Pour the yeast batter over this and carefully turn the mixture over with a spatula to blend,<br> just until all flour is moistened. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, <br>at least 4 hours or up to four days.</p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Turn dough out onto a floured surface; press into compact balls and knead about 6 turns to release air bubbles. Divide<br> dough into four equal parts. Shape one at a time. Refrigerate the remaining dough.</p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Roll one part of the dough on a floured board into a circle 17 inches in diameter. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, <br>cut the circle into eight equal pie-shaped wedges. Roll the wedges loosely toward the point. Shape each roll <br>into a crescent and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Allow 1 1/2 inches space between each roll.</p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Cover and let rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size. Approximately 2 hours. Meanwhile, <br>preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</p>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Brush croissants with beaten egg. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, until golden.</p>
