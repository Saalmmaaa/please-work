            <p>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</p>

            <p>1 tablespoon tomato paste</p>    
            <p>salt to taste</p>    
            <p>ground black pepper to taste</p>

            <h1>Tomato pasta</h1>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Place tomatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring just to a boil. Pour off water,<br> and cover again with cold water. Peel the skin off tomatoes and cut into small pieces.</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, <br>stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet or pan, making sure there is enough to cover<br> the bottom of the pan, and sauté garlic until opaque but not browned. Stir in tomato paste.<br> Immediately stir in the tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer until pasta is ready,<br> adding basil at the end. </p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Drain pasta, do not rinse in cold water. Toss with a bit of olive oil, then mix into the sauce.</p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Reduce heat as low as possible. Keep warm, uncovered, for about 10 minutes when <br>it is ready to serve. Garnish generously with fresh Parmesan cheese.</p>
